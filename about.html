            <p>About Me</p>
        </section>

        <section class="about_me_text">
            <p>I was born and raised in NE Ohio. I remained there until after graduating from college (or university)
                when I
                entered into the first of 12 years of total active duty service in the Army. In 2011, after a few
                cross-country moves and two long tours in Afghanistan I left active duty for the first time only to head
                back to Afghanistan for a year as an intelligence analyst.</p>

            <p>After that year (and some serious soul searching) I moved to Budapest, Hungary for two years and earned
                an
                MBA at Corvinus University of Budapest. While immersing myself in Hungarian culture and traveling
                extensively I somehow managed to excel academically, which included my thesis on the effects of a
                positive
                work environment on people suffering with mental illness. The intent of this these was to use what I
                learned
                to start a social enterprise graduationâ€¦</p>

            <p>Which is exactly what I did.</p>

            <p>Upon graduation in the summer of 2015 I moved to Los Angeles to start a small company, Logos Products,
                employing two recently homeless veterans and a fashion designer to make bags. We raised $25k in
                pre-orders
                for our tote bag, duffel, backpack, and fannypack through a crowdfunding campaign. The three of them
                spent
                the next year fulfilling these pre-orders while I tried (and failed) to generate opportunities to sell
                our
                products in the future. I severely miscalculated the barriers to entry of the LA farmers market scene
                which
                was one of the critical failures of Logos. So like all failed entrepreneurs I chose to pivot from a
                company
                with long-term prospects to a short-term project focused on setting up our employees for whatever came
                next
                for them. All in all, it was a financial disaster but a social success.</p>

            <p>Following the closure of Logos I went back onto active duty with the Army in 2017 and spent the next four
                years working unique assignments in Germany, Turkey, Jordan and UK. Following those four years I
                returned
                home to Cleveland, Ohio and began the pursuing my education in graphic and web design at Tri-C.</p>

            <p>In addition to geeking out on all things design I enjoy foods from across the world, French pressed
                coffee,
                long-distance running and traveling whenever I can. I've also volunteered for the U.S. Committee for
                Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) Cleveland Field Office.</p>
